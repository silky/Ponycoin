What is Bitcoin?
----------------

From the bitcoin README:

Bitcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitcoin Core software, see http://www.bitcoin.org/en/download.

What is Ponycoin?
----------------

In laymans terms:

Ponycoin is a modification of the bitcoin currency. Unlike bitcoin, however, the blockchain
in Ponycoins generate much faster than the bitcoin block chain, but give a smaller reward
to ponycoin miners.
